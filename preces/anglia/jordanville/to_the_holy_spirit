O Lord, Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, show compassion and have mercy
on me Thy sinful servant, and loose me from mine unworthiness, and forgive all
wherein I have sinned against Thee today as a man, and not only as a man,
but even worse than a beast, my sins voluntary and involuntary, known and unknown,
whether from youth, and from evil suggestion, or whether from brazenness and despondency.
If I have sworn by Thy name, or blasphemed it in my thought; or reproached anyone,
or slandered anyone in mine anger, or grieved anyone, or have become angry about anything;
or have lied, or slept needlessly, or if a beggar hath come to me and I disdained him;
or if I have grieved my brother, or have quarreled, or have condemned anyone;
or if I have been boastful, or prideful, or angry;
if, as I stood at prayer, my mind hath been distracted by the wiles of this world,
or by thoughts of depravity; if I have over-eaten, or have drukn excessively,
or laughed frivolously; if I have thought evil, or seen the beauty of another and
been wounded thereby in my heart; if I have said improper things,
or derided my brother's sin when mine own sins are countless;
if I have been neglectful of prayer, or have done some other wrong that I do not remember,
for all of this and more than this have I done: have mercy, O Master my Creator,
on me Thy downcast and unworthy servant, and loose me, and remit, and forgive me,
for Thou art good and the Lover of mankind, so that, lustful, sinful, and wretched as I am,
I may lie down and sleep and rest in peace. And I shall worship, and hymn, and glorify
Thy most honourable name, together with the Father and His Only-begotten Son, now and ever,
and unto the ages. Amen.
