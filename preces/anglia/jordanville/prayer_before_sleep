In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, for the sake of the prayers of Thy most
pure Mother, of our holy and Godbearing fathers and all the saints, have
mercy on us. Amen.
Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.
O Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, Who art everywhere present
and fillest all things; Treasury of good things and Giver of life: Come
and dwell in us, and cleanse us of all impurity, and save our souls,
O Good One.
Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. (Thrice.)
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and
ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
O Most Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord, blot out our sins. O Master,
pardon our iniquities. O Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for Thy
name's sake.
Lord, have mercy. (Thrice.)
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and
ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
Our Father, Who art in the heavens, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
