Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us; for at a loss for any
defense, this prayer do we sinners offer unto Thee as Master:
have mercy on us.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
Lord, have mercy on us; for we have hoped in Thee, be not angry
with us greatly, neither remember our iniquities; but look upon
us now as Thou art compassionate, and deliver us from our enemies,
for Thou are our God, and we, Thy people; all are the works of the
Thy hands, and we call upon Thy name.
Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The door of compassion open unto us, O blessed Theotokos, for,
hoping in thee, let us not perish; through thee may we be delivered
from adversities, for thou are the salvation of the Christian race.
Lord, have mercy. (Twelve times.)
