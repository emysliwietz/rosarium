O Eternal God and King of all creation, Who hast vouchsafed me to
arrive at this hour forgive me the sins that I have commited this
day in deed, word, and thought; and ccleanse, O Lord, to pass the
sleep of this night in peace; that, rising from my lowly bed,
I may please Thy most holy name all the days of my life, and thwart
the enemies, fleshly and bodiless, that war against me. And deliver
me, O Lord, from vain thoughts and evil desires which defile me.
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory:
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
