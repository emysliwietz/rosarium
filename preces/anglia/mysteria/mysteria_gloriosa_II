The Acts
1:9   And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up;
      and a cloud received him out of their sight.
1:10  And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold,
      two men stood by them in white apparel;
1:11  Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
      this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come
      in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
