John
2:1   And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
      mother of Jesus was there:
2:2   And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
2:3   And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have
      no wine.
2:4   Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is
      not yet come.
2:5   His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
2:6   And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the
      purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
2:7   Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
      them up to the brim.
2:8   And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the
      feast. And they bare it.
2:9   When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and
      knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;)
      the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
2:10  And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;
      and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast
      kept the good wine until now.
2:11  This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
      forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
2:12  After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
      brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
