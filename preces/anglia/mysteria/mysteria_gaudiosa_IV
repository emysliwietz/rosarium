Luke
2:22  And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were
      accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
2:23  (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the
      womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
2:24  And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of
      the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
