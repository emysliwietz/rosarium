Luke
3:21	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also
	being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
3:22	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and
	a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I
	am well pleased.
