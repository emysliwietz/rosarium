Luke
9:28  And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took
      Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
9:29  And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his
      raiment was white and glistering.
9:30  And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
9:31  Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should
      accomplish at Jerusalem.
9:32  But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when
      they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with
      him.
9:33  And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus,
      Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;
      one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he
      said.
9:34  While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they
      feared as they entered into the cloud.
9:35  And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son:
      hear him.
9:36  And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it
      close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had
      seen.
