Mark
14:17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
14:18	And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of
	you which eateth with me shall betray me.
14:19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I?
	and another said, Is it I?
14:20	And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that
	dippeth with me in the dish.
14:21	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that
	man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he
	had never been born.
14:22	And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and
	gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
14:23	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them:
	and they all drank of it.
14:24	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is
	shed for many.
14:25	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,
	until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
