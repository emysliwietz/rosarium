Luke
2:41  Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
      passover.
2:42  And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the
      custom of the feast.
2:43  And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus
      tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
2:44  But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
      journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
2:45  And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
      seeking him.
2:46  And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple,
      sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them
      questions.
2:47  And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
2:48  And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him,
      Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have
      sought thee sorrowing.
2:49  And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I
      must be about my Father's business?
2:50  And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
2:51  And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto
      them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
2:52  And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and
      man.
