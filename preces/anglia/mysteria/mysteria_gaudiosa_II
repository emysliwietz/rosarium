Luke
1:39  And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste,
      into a city of Juda;
1:40  And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
1:41  And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary,
      the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy
      Ghost:
1:42  And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among
      women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
1:43  And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
1:44  For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears,
      the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
1:45  And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of
      those things which were told her from the Lord.
1:46  And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
1:47  And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
1:48  For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from
      henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
1:49  For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his
      name.
1:50  And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
1:51  He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the
      imagination of their hearts.
1:52  He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low
      degree.
1:53  He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent
      empty away.
1:54  He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
1:55  As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
1:56  And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own
      house.
