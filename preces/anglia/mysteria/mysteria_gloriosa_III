The Acts
2:1   And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
      accord in one place.
2:2   And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,
      and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
2:3   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat
      upon each of them.
2:4   And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
      other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
2:5   And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every
      nation under heaven.
2:6   Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were
      confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
2:7   And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold,
      are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
2:8   And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
2:9   Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and
      in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
2:10  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about
      Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
2:11  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful
      works of God.
2:12  And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What
      meaneth this?
2:13  Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
