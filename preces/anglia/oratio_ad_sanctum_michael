℣. St. Michael the Archangel:
℟. Defend us in battle.
   Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.
   May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,
   and do thou,
   O Prince of the heavenly hosts,
   by the power of God,
   thrust into hell Satan,
   and all the evil spirits,
   who prowl about the world
   seeking the ruin of souls.
   Amen.

O glorious prince St. Michael,
chief and commander of the heavenly hosts,
guardian of souls, vanquisher of rebel spirits,
servant in the house of the Divine King
and our admirable conductor,
you who shine with excellence
and superhuman virtue deliver us from all evil,
who turn to you with confidence
and enable us by your gracious protection
to serve God more and more faithfully every day.
