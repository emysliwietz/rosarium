℣. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
℟. That we may be made worthy
   of the promises of Christ.

℣. Let us pray:
   O God, whose only-begotten Son,
   by His life, death, and resurrection,
   has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,
   grant, we beseech Thee,
   that, meditating upon these mysteries
   of the most holy rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
   we may imitate what they contain,
   and obtain what they promise.
   Through the same Christ our Lord.
   Amen.
