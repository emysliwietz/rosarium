# File for specifying Prayers in Rosarium
#
# Each page, seperated by '---' represents one tab of Rosarium
# Each page has a title, specifying the to-be-localized title of the window
# A list of prayer groups is optionally specified
# It sorts prayers into groups, which can be used in the order
# Finally, an order is specified
# It lists prayers in the order they should be prayed
# Groups can be used instead of filenames
# Prayers or groups in order can have the following attributes:
# count: Number of prayers to include from group (repeat if count highter than available)
# random: Whether to take prayers from group at random (potential repeats)
# chance: Percentage indicating how likely this prayer/group is to be included
